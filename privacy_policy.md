**Last updated: January 2025**

## Overview

Readlang More Examples is a browser extension that helps language learners get additional example sentences while using Readlang flashcards.

## Data Collection

### What we collect
- **API Keys**: Your AI provider API key is stored locally in Chrome's sync storage to authenticate requests to your chosen AI provider.
- **Settings**: Your selected AI provider and model preferences are stored locally.

## Data Storage

All data is stored locally on your device using Chrome's built-in storage API (`chrome.storage.sync`). This data syncs across your Chrome browsers if you're signed into Chrome, but is never sent to us.

## Third-Party Services

When you click "More Examples", the extension sends the current vocabulary word to your chosen AI provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, Mistral, Google, or OpenRouter) to generate example sentences. Please review the privacy policy of your chosen AI provider:

## Data Security
